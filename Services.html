            <h1>SERVING FASHION SINCE 1985</h1>
            It all began in Durban, South Africa. One idea by two visionaries quickly grew to multiple stores around the country. Fast forward more than thirty years later and now weâ€™re bringing hot fashion across ladies, mens and kids at unbelievable value to stores across Africa, and worldwide through mrprice.com and the DRPYS APP - where you can find the latest additions like Scarlet Hill beauty, baby wear, schoolgear as well as tech gadgets and pets accesories by DRPS&co.
